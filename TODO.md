# Features to add (if only I had an app to keep track of these...)

*Most of these are just ideas, I don't know if they are even possible*
Feel free to add ideas to this (or open an issue) for features you'd like to see

- Multiple notes topics (ideas, classes, or whatever)
    - directories, and ability to switch between??
	- different branches in same directory??
- Reading notes without editing
- Better method of checking default editor
- Settings
    - default editor (maybe even, god forbid, the use of a GUI one *Crowd ghasps*)
    - notes directory location
    - remote repository
- Somehow have images
- Search for different notes containing phrases
