### Future Features / Ideas:
**May not be up-to-date; see TODO.md**

- Multiple notes topics (ideas, classes, or whatever)
    - directories, and ability to switch between??
    - different branches in same directory??
- Reading notes without editing
- Better method of checking default editor
- Settings
    - default editor (maybe even, god forbid, the use of a GUI one Crowd ghasps)
    - notes directory location
    - remote repository
- Somehow have images
- Search for different notes containing phrase
